Data Retrieval for Authenticated Users

We prioritize the privacy and security of our users' personal data. We strive to collect and process the minimum necessary information to provide a seamless experience through our mobile application. Here's how we handle data retrieval for authenticated users:

Authentication Process: To offer enhanced features and personalized services, we provide the option for users to sign in to our mobile application using their Google account. This authentication process allows users to securely access their personalized content and preferences across devices.

Data Collection: During the authentication process, we retrieve basic profile information from your Google account, such as your name and email address. This information is used solely for authentication purposes and is not stored or shared with any third parties.

Data Usage: The retrieved profile information is utilized exclusively for authentication and account management within our mobile application. We do not collect any additional personal data from your Google account or any other sources.

Data Security: We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of your authenticated user data. Our systems and infrastructure are designed to safeguard your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration.

User Control: You have full control over the data retrieval process. By choosing to authenticate through your Google account, you consent to the retrieval of the specified profile information solely for the purpose of enhancing your experience within our mobile application. At any time, you can revoke access or update your account preferences through the settings within the mobile application.

Data Deletion: If you decide to terminate your account, the profile information retrieved during the authentication process will be permanently deleted from our systems. We do not retain any personal data beyond the duration of your active account.

Please note that we do not collect any additional personal information from your device or through any other means. We adhere to the principles of data minimization and strive to provide a privacy-focused experience for our users.
